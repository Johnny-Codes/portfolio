      <h1 className="text-3xl text-center py-4">Hello &#128075; My name is Paul Johns</h1>
      <p className="py-4 indent-8 text-lg">
        I'm a dynamic software developer bringing a unique blend of military
        experience and entrepreneurial spirit to the tech world. After 8 years
        of serving in Special Operations Forces, where I held the role of
        Psychological Operations Sergeant, I'm excited to embark on a new
        journey in the tech industry. My coding journey started with five years
        of self-teaching, complemented by formal education in a coding bootcamp.

        During my military service, I maintained a secret security clearance and
        honed my adaptability, leadership, and team collaboration skills. Beyond
        my military background, I'm a passionate numismatist who founded two
        rare coin businesses. Faced with the limitations of existing solutions,
        I developed my own inventory management system, showcasing my
        proficiency in languages like Python, JavaScript, React, and TypeScript.
        Additionally, my experience as an ecommerce manager for one of the
        largest coin companies globally has equipped me with skills in digital
        marketing, SEO, and online sales.
      </p>
      <p className="py-4 indent-8 text-lg">
        Known for my rapid learning abilities, I'm currently expanding my
        knowledge into languages such as C and embedded programming. What
        motivates me is the process of bringing ideas to lifeâ€”turning concepts
        into tangible results. Looking forward, my professional goals include
        transitioning successfully into the tech industry, continuous learning,
        and eventually becoming a senior developer and mentor for junior
        software developers.
      </p>
      <p className="py-4 indent-8 text-lg">
        In terms of work philosophy, I believe in getting the job done with
        unwavering determination. Whether leading or contributing to a team, I
        pride myself on delivering results without compromise. Outside of the
        tech realm, I find joy in numismatics, strumming my guitar, exploring
        robotics, and indulging in survival camping adventures.
